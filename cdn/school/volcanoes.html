                <p class="fancy">The eruption of Eyjafjallaj&ouml;kull caused many delays in airlines. Even Airlines that don't go to Iceland were delayed because of the giant ash cloud that was covering the upper portions of Europe and North America. Because of this, other flights were rectroactivley cancelled because of saftey reasons arising from the ash cloud. These delays and cencellations ended on April 20<sup>th</sup>, 2010. According to the Insitute of Earth Sciences at the University of Iceland and the Icelandic Meteorological Office declared the eruption over in October of the same year. This volcanic eruption affected tens of thousands of travellers, and an event of this size will probably not happen for a long time. </p>
